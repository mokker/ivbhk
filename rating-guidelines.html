		<h2>
			<strong>Individual Ratings</strong></h2>
		<p>
			All players participating in IVB.hk will be rated for their individual skill level, in a range from A+ (highest) to D (lowest).</p>
		<p>
			An individual&#39;s overall rating evaluates their ability relative to other players in Hong Kong in each of the basic skills of the game: serving, passing, setting, hitting, blocking, and defense.</p>
		<p>
			Initially, new members will rate themselves when filling out their IVB.hk profile. &nbsp;The following guidelines should be applied when rating individuals.</p>
		<p>
			It can be difficult for a new IVB.hk member to rate his own skills, e.g., to know whether his passing is worth a 3 (C), 4 (C+), or some other rating. Another way for a new IVB.hk member to select a rating is to find a current IVB.hk member with similar skills and select a rating close to his/her. As a general rule of thumb, a beginning player without much skill and only rudimentary knowledge of offense, defense, and strategy is a D. As this player gains more understanding of what is expected, but still without much skill, he will move up to C- and then to C. A C+ can generally play two positions well but is not necessarily consistent at all positions. Players at the B- through B+ levels are consistent at every position and have good court sense, with B+ being more skillful and smarter than B-. Players that play at the A- to A+ level are at the level of strong college level players.&nbsp;</p>
		<p>
			Players will be assessed on their player competency of their basic skills.&nbsp; The criterions used to more precisely breakdown individual player ratings are as follows:</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Hitting: </strong></p>
		<ol type="I">
			<li>
				Player will hit the ball over the net, but will rarely use any force. He is just as likely to hit the ball into the net or out of bounds as he is to hit it into a playable area.</li>

			<li>
				Player hits the ball in bounds and with force. He is generally overpowering, and can hit the ball to open locations over blocks.</li>

		<p>
			<strong>Passing:</strong></p>

			If you have been nationally rated, please provide your country&rsquo;s rating. At the discretion of the event organizer, its encouraged that individuals not play in IVB.hk games that are more than three levels below their individual rating (e.g., &quot;A-&quot; players may play in a &quot;B-&quot; game, but not in a &quot;C+&quot; game) because of safety reasons.</p>

		<p>
			<span style="color:#ff0000;"><b>For all intent and purposes, women playing on a mens net (235cm, 240cm or 243cm) is calculated as one tick lower whether in regular, league or tournament play (e.g. &quot;B-&quot; players will be calculated as &quot;C+&quot;).</b></span></p>

		<p>
			Any IVB.hk member can request a ratings change for himself/herself or recommend a ratings change for other members. The Ratings Committee or Administrator will evaluate all requested or recommended ratings changes. If a ratings change is warranted the Ratings Chairpersons will notify the member in writing by email.</p>
